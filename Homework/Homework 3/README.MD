1. [20 points] **Synchronization**

In the following code, three processes produce output using the routine putc and synchronize using two semaphores L and R.

/\* Initialize the two semaphores \*/

semaphore L = 4;

semaphore R = 0;

| /
 | /\* Process 2 \*/
 | /\* Process 3 \*/
 |
| --- | --- | --- |

```c++
\*/ Process 1 \*/
while (true) {
    wait(L);
    putc('C');
    signal(R);
}
```
```c++
\*/ Process 2 \*/
while (true) {
    wait(R);
    putc('A');
    putc('B');
    signal(R);
}
```
```c++
\*/ Process 3 \*/
while (true) {
    wait(R);
    putc('D');
}
```

Please answer the following questions. (Hint: Process 2 or Process 3 has to wait for Process 1 to run at least once with semaphoreR initialized to 0).

1. What is the minimum and the maximum number of D's that might be printed when this set of processes runs? (Hint: If a fixed number of D will be printed, the minimum and the maximum are the same)
2. What is the minumum and the maximum number of A's that might be printed when this set of processes runs? (Hint: If a fixed number of A will be printed, the minimum and the maximum are the same)
3. Is CABDCDABABCABDCD a possible output sequence when this set of processes runs?
4. Is CABABACDBCABDDCD a possible output sequence when this set of processes runs?

    1. Maximum and minimum is 4.
    2. Smallest 0 and maximum infinity. This is because the process 2 could go on to rerun infinity times because it waits and signals R
    3. No
    4. Yes

1. **[30 points]**  **Deadlocks**

Consider the following snapshot of a system:

Answer the following questions using the banker's algorithm:

1. (5 points) What is the content of the matrix _Need_ denoting the number of resources needed by each process?

1. (10 points) Is the system in a safe state? Why?

**Yes** , (P3, P4, P1, P0, P2) shows that the system is in a safe state.

Init state:

**Answer:** Yes, (P3, P4, P1, P0, P2)

1. (5 points) If a request from process P0 arrives for (0, 1, 0, 1), can the request be granted immediately? Why?

No, because it doesn't fulfil the first requirement that which in this case is .

1. (10 points) If a request from process P2 arrives for (0, 1, 0, 1), can the requested be granted immediately? Why?

No. The request fulfils the first two requirements where but the system is not in a safe state and therefore can't process the request immediately.

1. **[****3****0 points]**  **Memory Management**

1) (15 points) Part of the page table is shown here:

| page | frame |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 5 |
| 1 | 4 |
| 2 | 3 |
| 3 | 2 |
| 4 | 7 |

What are the physical addresses for the following logical addresses in binary?

a. 00111110

b. 11000101

c. 10101110

d. 01010101

e. 01101011

Because the logical address is

1. 001 = Page 1.
2. 110 = Page 6. Page 6 is not shown
3. 101 = Page 5. Page 5 is not shown
4. 010 = Page 2.
5. 011 = Page 3.

2) (15 points) Consider the following segment table:

| Segment | Base | Length |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 219 | 600 |
| 1 | 2300 | 14 |
| 2 | 90 | 100 |
| 3 | 1327 | 580 |
| 4 | 1952 | 96 |

What are the physical addresses for the following logical addresses?

a. 0,410

b. 1,10

c. 2,500

d. 3,380

e. 4,112

1. 410+219=629
2. 10+2300=2310
3. Illegal address because the length of segment 2 is 100 and offset is 500.
4. 380+1327=1707
5. Illegal address because the length of segment 4 is 96 and offset is 112.
